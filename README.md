# BatteryAnalysis

We extracted Panasonic 18650PF Li-ion Battery Data from Mendeley Data and converted it to Excel then imported it via python.
We then created a web Gui that displays graphical results and allows you to input dynamic results to estimate the performance of the battery based on the
data extracted. 
The project is deployed on a web application on AWS using Route53,Ec2, and SSL certificates.
